# 42-GetNextLine

*This repository contains the get_next_line project from 42 Cursus.*

## Overview
get_next_line is 1/3 projects of Milestone One. The idea of GNL is to read and return the next line from a **File Descriptor**. Other than that, this project provides a good opportunity to strengthen your knowledge about variables (static and non-static), buffer handling, memory management and FD tables. :shipit:

# Project Details
**get_next_line.c** contains the main functions; *reda_storage*, *extract_line*, *get_next_line*.

**get_next_line_utils** contains the  helper functions used in the main .C file. Since libft is not allowed in the scope of this project, I modified the helper functions to be applicable to GNL.

**get_next_line.h**

## Additional Notes
> [!NOTE]
> I suffered, a lot. I lost a lot of hair and I still have terrible memory.
> Additionally, I learnt about the (forbidden) Ternary Operator and Inode table while researching into GNL.
